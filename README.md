Created using React/HTML5/CSS3/SASS :+1:

## How to use
Clone or Download and simply open _index.html_ in your browser.
## Enhancing user experience
I added **Load More** to enable paging which helps with usability. More obviously can be done to make the user experience better like: 
- Adding filters
- Loading news into modals instead of expanding within the list
## Browser Compatibility
Tested on latest Chrome and Safari only.
## Tests
TDD tests for **NewsList** can be found in **test** folder

Thanks for your time.
