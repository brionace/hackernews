# hackernews
Created using React/HTML5/CSS3/SASS :+1:
## Compatibility
Tested on latest Chrome and Safari only
## Tests
TDD tests for **NewsList** can be found in **test** folder
## Enhancing user experience
I added **Load More** to enable paging which helps with usability. More obviously can be done to make the user experience better like: 
- Adding filters
- Loading news into modals instead of expanding within the list

Thanks for your time.
